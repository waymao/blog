Today I went to an Apple Store to fix my Mac's keyboard. 
The very lovely Apple Store staff told me that due to a leap day last year,
the extended warranty on my Mac expired yesterday.
Well, I was just one day from that free keyboard replacement. That
was unlucky.

In a not-so-good mood, I walked out of the IAPM mall. As I was walking to the subway station, a recently-opened Five Guys appeared across the street.

Ok, I guess I'll try it. I walked toward this store, getting mentally ready for my impulse purchase. As I was opening the door, that familiar American R&B and Punk music quickly overwhelmed that unique scent in that high-end, luxurious mall that I just walked out of.

I looked around. There were the red and white tiles. There were potato bags on the ground. And there were some large soft drink machines standing in the dining area. The burgers were as expensive as it was in the US. Even the store manager was kind of having that pot belly.

I became super excited. It was my first contact with the American culture in a year, after I came home and studied remotely because of covid. It almost felt like I was back in the US, riding a Ford Mustang, with windows rolled down and Drake's music at maximum volume.

Walking to the counter, I ordered a hot dog and a cup of cajun fries -- that cajun fries is one of my favorite fried food in America. As I was paying, I looked for my American Express credit card, which would give me 4 membership points per dollar on restaurant purchases. Soon I realized that I didn't even bring my wallet. I tried to use that card in Apple Pay, but the POS machine apparently decided not to respond to my sudden yearning for my life in America.

"Well, I guess I had no choice but to use this WeChat Pay QRCode, then." Feeling embarrassed, I launched WeChat on my smartphone, opened up the payment Code, and showed that to the cashier.

今天去修电脑键盘，apple store小姐姐热情地告诉我，因为闰年问题它已经在昨天过保了。心情一般的我走出iapm，望到了隔壁刚开张的五个伙计汉堡店。

抱着试一试的态度，我走进了这家门店，为我的冲动消费做准备。
扑面而来的美国R&B和朋克BGM，
跟刚才走出的iapm中弥漫的特制香氛气简直就是一个天一个地。

我环顾四周，无论是红白相间的装潢，
还是地上躺着的土豆袋子，除了窗明几净之外，
和我去过的那家纽约五个家伙汉堡店，几乎完全一样。
连引导的似乎是店长的那位大叔也是大腹便便的。

我内心瞬间激动了起来。我想这是疫情开始后除了央视天天报道美国疫情以外，
对美国最近的接触之一了。我仿佛回到了美国，
坐在一辆福特野马里，磕着药，摇下窗子把Drake的音乐开到最大，
跟着背景音乐的节奏摇起头跳起舞来。

走上点餐台，我华丽地点上全牛热狗和一杯薯条——
这个薯条无疑是美国快餐给我留下印象最深刻的地方。
结账时，正打算用那张吃饭返4点的美国运通信用卡。
然而，我翻遍了整个包，却发现我连钱包没带。无奈的我打开apple pay，
准备用apple pay支付，可惜碰了几次也不管用，
这台pos机根本就不打算认这张卡。

“那就扫码算了。”我尴尬又为难地打开了微信，点开了支付码。
